// This file intentionally still holds MOCK data — unlike bookings, POS
// stock, and staff (which now read from the real database via Prisma),
// true channel-manager sync with Airbnb/Booking.com/MakeMyTrip requires
// becoming an approved API partner with each platform. That's a business
// process (applications, sometimes volume minimums), not something any
// codebase can just "connect." This preview shows what that screen will
// look like once those integrations are in place.
